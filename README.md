# list-implementations
Lists made from arrays and nodes creating linked lists in C++

This is a lab that we completed in my data structures and algorithms course. It demonstrates the differences between implementing a list structure using arrays and using linked nodes to create a linked list. All of the same tests are performed on each implementation of the list, and because they are both lists, they perform the same way to the user, however, algorithmically the two implementations are very different. 

This was used as practice for creating lists from different structures in C++ and also as practice using OOP in C++.
